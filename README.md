# 8-bit-binary-calculator
This is a calculator that has an input in binary and output on a 0.91 oled screen. Sadly it can only do addition as of now but this is the reason why i added a pico pi so i later can add multiplication division and subtraction. I didnt create a case yet but when the parts arrive and i know how big it will be i can working on that.

# Parts not on the PCB
I will be using bigger switches like this that are connected to the board via cables

the screen will be the one that i got for my hackpad but didnt use
also next to the switches will be LEDs that indicate the state of that bit
